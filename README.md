# **Los Santos Mini Guide**

### **Overview**

This is my city guide project for my Google-sponsored Android Basics Nanodegree at Udacity.

The app uses a tab layout with fragments and has responsive toolbar that looks a bit like a co-ordinator layout
but in fact uses constraint animation to achieve the collapsing effect.

Here's a video of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ea11JKLwdI&t=1s
